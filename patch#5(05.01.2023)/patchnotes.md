*Not many changes have been made to the client files, so these are just the patchnotes given by the devs. Only added them for completeness-sake.*

## [Features]
1. Added Leave for a While function to card upgrades *(to be able to save a combination result and retry it another time)*

1. Cards and Specialties of non-captain characters now do not apply in 1on1 mode
2. Added the elo system to 1on1 mode
3. Adjusted the conditions for some Team Buffs to be effective
4. Temporarily remove some Team Buff
5. Adjusted matchmaking rules to shorten matchmaking time
6. The skill bar only shows the skills that can be triggered by the character currently being operated（1on1 mode）

## [Bug Fixes]
1. Fixed a game crash bug caused by Sep mode *(not actually fixed)*
2. Fixed a game crash bug caused by battle viewing
3. Fixed an issue with the single player mode not being able to connect
